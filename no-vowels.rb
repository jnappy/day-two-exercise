require 'pry'

# write a function called `without_vowles` that accepts one parameter called `favorite_word`
# within the function, create a variable called `word_without_vowels` and set it equal to the `favorite_word` without vowels (hint:  delete or replace the vowels with an empty string) 
# then, the function should make the computer say aloud "FAVORITE_WORD sounds like WORD_WITHOUT_VOWELS when it doens't have vowels"
# (you can do this a few ways - I recommend using `.gsub!(` and `system("say('...')")

# ask the user for their favorite word
# store their word in a variable called `user_favorite_word`

# call the functions with the the user's word
